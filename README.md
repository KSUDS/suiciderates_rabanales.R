# Suicides Rates in Country

- __Project Purpose:__ Suicide is a serious public health problem, most at risks are those who has mental disorder. There is an association between the two such as depression, bipolor disorder, and many more that contributes. 
- Every year 703 000 people take their own life and there are many more people who attempt suicide. Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities and entire countries and has long-lasting effects on the people left behind. Suicide occurs throughout the lifespan and was the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds globally in 2019. (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/suicide)
- I decide to use this data to looking into the variables country, suicides population, and seperating the years. This project was for my own personal preference.


- __Tools used:__ I used R programming for this project and many packages: tidyverse, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, statar, and RColorBrewer. The final scripts are suicide.R shows the process of filtering years, transformation, and fixing up the data.

- __Results:__
